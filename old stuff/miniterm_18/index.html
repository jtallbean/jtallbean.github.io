    <h1>intro</h1>
    <p>This year for my miniterm project I worked on developing and building an Arduino based controller
      for a WS2812B addressable RGB LED strip.  This would allow me to use the LED strip to carry out
      a variety of tasks, such as displaying a rainbow wave, pulsing various colors, as a visualizer for
      music, and many more!</p>
    <p>Arduino controllers are extremely powerful, and can do almost anything you tell them to, short of
      making you a sandwich.  As stated on the Arduino.cc website:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction">
      Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino
      boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and
      turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can
      tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board.
    </blockquote>
    <p>The project is built using the Arduino IDE, which can be obtained

    <p>A picture of most of the parts laid out.  The writing in the image details the specifications of
      the WS2812B strip used.  With 60 LEDs in it, it draws 18 watts of power, requires an input voltage
      of 5V DC, and draws 3.6 amps of current, or 0.06 amps per LED.</p>
    <img src="/miniterm_18/images/parts.jpg" alt="all the parts used">
    <p>About midway through the project I realized that power draw would be an issue.  If the Pro Micro
      is drawing too much power, it will 'freeze' and be unresponsive to new commands.  There are multiple
      ways to tackle this problem.  Perhaps the simplest solution is to chop off a few LEDs, thus lowering
      the power requirement.  Another solution is to use another external power supply that is capable of
      providing the 3.6 amps required.</p>

    <h1>process</h1>
    <p>Before I began this project, I had not had much experience using the Arduino board or the software,
      so I first started off by putting the name of the Pro Micro into almighty google.  Google returned
      a list of several very helpful sources, including one by Adafruit covering the usage and pinout of the
      Pro Micro controller, seen below.</p>
    <img src="/miniterm_18/images/pinout.png" alt="pinout of the controller"/>
    <p>There are multiple versions of the Pro Micro that have been released - a 3.3V/8MHz one, and a
      5V/16MHz version.  If you can, be sure to pick up the 5V/16MHz version, which is the one that I am
      using, as it will allow you to output more power through the VCC pin.  For my project, the only pins
      that are used are VCC, GND, and pin 4.  VCC and GND are used to provide power to the WS2812B strip,
      whereas pin 4 is used to output the data that is used to control the colors of the strip.</p>
    <p>After downloading the Arduino IDE from the link above, we will need to pick up the Pro Micro specific
      board (.brd) files in order to communicate with the board itself.  Instructions on how to do so can
      be found
      <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pro-micro--fio-v3-hookup-guide#windows_boardaddon">here</a></p>
    <p>Next, we need to hook up the actual RGB LED strip to the board using the three pins mentioned above.
      Although it is not necessary, I recommend using a decoupling capacitor in parallel between the VCC and
      GND pins in order to sanitize your power input.  As the power draw of the strip will vary wildly depending
      on the colors displayed as well as the number of LEDs active, this resistor will help balance everything out.
      A recommended size is anywhere from 100 - 1000μF, though I used a 10μF since it was the only one I had
      available.  Another component that I recommend is a resistor in series on the data line, which is pin 4.
      This works to sanitize the data input for the strip.  The WS2812B consists of many small ICs, and the
      capacitor + resistor will help protect these components!</p>
    <p>In order to plan everything out, I drew up the circuit diagram below</p>
    <img src="/miniterm_18/images/circuit.jpg" alt="circuit diagram">
    <p>The circuit also includes an optional 2-way switch on the GND line, which I included in order to be able
      to power the device on and off without having to remove the MicroUSB cable.  This allows me to simply and
      quickly restart the device in the case of any issues.  I also included a push button between RST and GND.
      If the pro micro ever encounters any issues or becomes 'bricked', the inclusion of a button will make shorting
      RST and GND a simple task!</p>
    <p>However, I should point out that neither of those components (capacitor, resistor, button), are necessary.
      I do highly recommend them if you have the components at hand!</p>
    <p>I wanted to be able to use the WS2812B strip as a backlight for my monitor, so I laid it out according to my
      monitor dimensions.  As seen in the image below, there are 20 LEDs across the top, 16 down each side, and 4
      on either side of the monitor stand.  The individual strips are chained together, with GND->GND, VCC->VCC, and
      DOUT->DIN</p>
    <img src="/miniterm_18/images/layout.jpg" alt="led layout">
    <p>Although it is perfectly alright to use a breadboard or to socket the Pro Micro and use header pins to connect
      everything up, I wanted something that would be neater on the outside, something that I could leave on my desk
      and not have it looking like a rat's nest.  I found a neat battery case that happened to match the dimensions of
      the Pro Micro almost exactly.  Using my flush cutters, I was able to cut out holes in the case in order to fit
      everything inside.  I used a soldering station - Hakko FX-888D to be specific - to wire everything up and tested
      continuity with a multimeter to make sure there were no bridged pins.</p>
    <p>The completed device is shown below</p>
    <img src="/miniterm_18/images/internals.jpg" alt="all the parts used">
    <img src="/miniterm_18/images/cutout.jpg" alt="all the parts used">
    <p>In the first pic, the three VCC, GND, and Data wires coming from the WS2812B are not soldered in yet, and the
      opening for the microUSB can be seen on the top side.  In the second pic, everything has been squeezed inside and
      the hole for the microUSB port is seen.</p>
    <p>Next, we are able to hook up the strip and upload the code to it.  The Adafruit NeoPixel LED library contains many
      useful and helpful functions which we can borrow from in order to make ours.</p>
